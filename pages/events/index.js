This book serves as a reminder of our traditions. Additionally, we participated in the daily activities of the Mongolian Community Association, contributing to the organization and celebration of various events.\n\nFor the National Naadam Festival, we organized a race for the youngest participants (ages 2-5) and awarded a $100 prize to the child who finished last, affectionately called the 'Bayan Khodood' (Big Belly), in honor of the traditional Mongolian horse racing, which divides children into different age groups. In Mongolian tradition, the child who finishes last in the 'daaga' (colt) race is called 'Bayan Khodood,' and they are given a prize similar to the winner's, with the blessing: 'This year's Bayan Khodood will become next year's winner!' This beautiful tradition will continue to be honored by the Mongolian Cultural Center in the years to come.\n\nWe also initiated a project to give gifts to children born between July 11, 2023, and July 10, 2024. These gifts include a photo frame to preserve the child's memorable moments, treats, and a bell-shaped shoe decoration that jingles as the child moves. We wish for these little ones to grow up happy, healthy, and full of joy, and extend my best wishes to their parents and families",
